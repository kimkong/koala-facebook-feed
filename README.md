Using the Koala gem to pull a Facebook Page's wall feed.  Using bootstrap-sass and custom css to format the feed to mimic facebook feel.

Main attraction of this method is the swapping of the small images with the larger repository images and layouts that are specific to the type of feed update.

Currently skips all status updates that are not meaningful, such as likes.
